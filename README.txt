In the project, 3 HTML sites are created, with 3 CSS stylesheet linked to the HTML.
The HTML pages include a index.html, which has a link to the other two HTML page called resume.html and bio.html. Also, both html has a "back" link to the index.html.
The webpage will not work well on a small screen, like a mobile phone. All the testings were done through a MacBook.

I worked alone on this project. Consulted stack overflow for help on CSS styling

I spent 5 hours in total on this project. CSS styling is very time consuming

!! I have also learned the importance of using git, since I accidentally rm -rf all my files.. !!
